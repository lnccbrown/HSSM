The `hssm.likelihoods` submodule exports a few likelihood functions. These functions
are already used in the model building process for some supported models, such as `ddm`,
`ddm_sdv`, and `full_ddm`, so you typically would not have to deal with them. However,
they can be helpful if you want to use them to build a model yourself in PyMC. Please
checkout the [this tutorial](../tutorials/pymc.ipynb) for more details.
