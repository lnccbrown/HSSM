The `hssm.distribution_utils` contains useful functions for building `pm.Distribution`
classes. Other than the `download_hf` function that downloads ONNX models shared on our
[huggingface model repository](https://huggingface.co/franklab/HSSM/tree/main), you will
generally not have to use these functions. For advanced users who want to build their
own PyMC models, they can use these functions to create `pm.Distribution` and
`RandomVariable` classes that they desire.
