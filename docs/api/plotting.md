The `hssm.plotting` module provide functionalities to create HSSM-specific plots such
as the posterior predictive plots. Please checkout
[the plotting tutorial](../tutorials/plotting.ipynb) for more examples on how to use
these functions. Note that each plotting function has an equivalent in the
[`hssm.HSSM`](hssm.md) class, so you can call these functions from a built model without
having to import these functions.
